# docker run

Our documentation provides two ways that you may start up a TVApp2 docker container:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-circle: &nbsp; [docker run](docker-run.md)

    ---

    Spin up the TVApp2 container using the `docker run` command. 
    This is useful for quick launches, but is not time efficient
    if you plan to use this container long-term.

    This requires a longer command that must be used each time
    you wish to bring the container up.

-   :material-circle: &nbsp; [docker compose](docker-compose.md)

    ---

    Spin up the TVApp2 container by creating a `ðŸ“„ docker-compose.yml`
    file which will store all of your options such as env variables,
    mounted volumes, and labels.

    To bring the container up, `cd` into the folder with the 
    `ðŸ“„ docker-compose.yml` file, and run the
    command `docker compose up -d`.

</div>

<br />

The `ðŸ—” docker run` command allows you to start up a docker container by providing a set of [options](#command-options) which define how the container should operate, including the environment variables, mounted volumes, assigned IP address, etc.

## Start TVApp2

Pulling the image if needed and starting the container. To spin up a TVApp2 container using this method; run a command similar to the below example. See the section [Options](#options) below for a list of what you can specify.

=== "Terminal"

    ```shell
    docker run -d \
    --restart=unless-stopped \ # (1)!
    --name tvapp2 \ # (2)!
    -p 4124:4124 \ # (3)!
    -e "TZ=Etc/UTC" \ # (4)!
    -v ${PWD}/app:/usr/bin/app \ # (5)!
    ghcr.io/thebinaryninja/tvapp2:latest # (6)!
    ```

    1.  Specifies what happens if the container becomes unresponsive or goes down.
    2.  Name to assign the container; otherwise, a random id will be given.
    3.  Port that will be used for the container
    4.  Environment variable which specifies the timezone to use for the container.
    5.  Mount the container volume `/usr/bin/app` to your host machine in the subfolder `./app`
    6.  Specifies what docker image to spin up.

<br />

To confirm that the container has been brought up, run the command `docker ps | grep tvapp2`. If you have the app [Portainer](https://portainer.io/), you can sign into your admin interface and view your TVApp2 container details, instead of using a command-line.

```

```
